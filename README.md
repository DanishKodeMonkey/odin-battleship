# odin-battleship

## A game of battleship, crated through javascript.

Through my recent ventures in [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-more-testing) I have come to try various intermediate and advanced features/techniques that need some testing out.

Most recent of these being an approach to programming called TDD, or Test Driven Development.
So now it's time to try out what I've learned.

To clarify:
This project is not just about putting together some code, and booms'ya uncle here's a game.

It's about the journey towards the end project. Using all the tools and techniques I've learned over the last few courses to have a solid journey coding this project.

### What's the plan.

SO since I am going to make the project using a TDD approach, it's gonna be important to take things one at a time.

Write a test, make it pass. Write another test, make that pass too.

I'm excited to see what kind of shenanigans I can get into while doing this.

My main focus for the testing aspect will be in testing as much asa I can of the underlying logic of the script, so the DOM is not what's going to be tested this time around, though I will try to test some of the underlying DOM manipulation functions before I code them. ( that still sounds funky in my head )

While testing is a big point of the practice, testing the DOM elements of the project is out of scope for this exercise.
